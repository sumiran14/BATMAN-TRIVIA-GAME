# BATMAN-TRIVIA-GAME
This game is a treat for anyone who is a fan of DC Comics. Since I am not such a big fan, the questions in this game are based on the movies. The Batman trilogy by Christopher Nolan and V for Vendetta. 
Their are following rules to the game:
There are 1-16 numbers and some of them are obstacle numbers.  Your initial position is 1 and the aim is for you to reach number 16 to win the game
There are three levels of questions: easy. Medium and hard. Easy wins you one point, Medium wins 2 and hard wins you three
If you encounter a obstacle number (they won't change through the game), your position will be setback by the number of time you have played the game

This game uses file handling techniques and the code for the same have been shared. If someone wants to play this game, the binary files named “easy,medium and hard” (all with .dat extensions) must be downloaded and be in the same folder as the code.
